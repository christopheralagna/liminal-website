      <h1>Donate / Volunteer</h1>
      <div class="aspens-img"></div>
      <h3>Monetary Donations</h3>
      <p class="p-larger">Monetary donations will be absolutely essential to our successful startup. You can contribute in this way by following the link to our <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-support-marginalized-community-art-center?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_campaign=p_cf+share-flow-1">gofundme</a>.</p>
      <p class="p-larger">Liminal is a non-profit, and therefore it will put all of its funds back into its community projects and moral purposes. As things move along, we will try our best to maintain 100% financial transparency on our website. This will include posting information about existing contributions, showing funding amounts for particular projects, and providing other relevant financial documentation.</p>
      <h3>Material Donations</h3>
      <p class="p-larger">Just as helpful as monetary donations, are the following types of donation:</p>
      <ul class="material-donations-list">
        <li><b>Books</b> that are educational, anti-capitalist, feminist, anti-racist, anti-imperialist, or otherwise radically community-oriented. These books will be used to create a small library for free daily use.</li>
        <li><b>Clothing</b> which we will use for an ongoing clothing-swap project.</li>
        <li><b>Art supplies</b> which we will offer for free use in our space.</li>
        <li><b>Essential resources</b> of any kind, which we will use for mutual aid efforts.</li>
        <li><b>Plants</b> which we will take good care, and find a pretty spot for within our space.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="p-larger">Reach out and ask us if youâ€™re wanting to give anything else you think might be of use!</p>
      <h3>Volunteering</h3>
      <p class="p-larger">Alongside monetary and material donations, there are many other ways you can help. Liminal will be constantly developing arts and community projects that will require collective support. There are many current startup projects that we need help with-</p>
      <ul class="material-donations-list">
        <li><b>Love plants or have botanical experience?</b><br>Help us build a hanging garden! This will be a permanent installation for the interior of Liminal.</li>
        <li><b>Like woodworking or interior building projects?</b><br>Help us renovate our space! We will need help with the construction of shelving, cabinetry, art and picture hanging, and more.</li>
        <li><b>Have experience with art curation or event organizing?</b><br>Help us plan our first exhibitions! We will need artists, ideas for themes, project planners, and those who are well connected to the community.</li>
        <li><b>Love cooking, baking, or the cultural preservation of food?</b><br>Help us design an ever-evolving cafe menu! We want to spread important perspectives on food and culture, and to uplift underrecognized cooks, cuisines, and food histories.</li>
        <li><b>Want to teach or to share your unique skill sets?</b><br>Host classes or workshops with us! More information on this essential Liminal program can be found <a href="classes+workshops.html">here</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="p-larger">The work of Liminal can only be carried out by the collective efforts, combined skill sets, and unique ideas of our community. This moreover, is how Liminal is meant to operate. We invite anyone and everyone to participate in the process of building Liminal. If you have any interest in working with us, or have any questions about more ways you can help, we encourage you to <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> directly!</p>
