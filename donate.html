        <h2>Monetary Donations</h2>
        <p>All facets of Liminal are free to access or pay-what-you-can, including the space, its material resources, and all our events. That said, we are completely funded through community donations. Therefore we encourage that those of you who are able to contribute choose to do so.</p>
        <h3>One-time Donations</h3>
        <p>No matter how much money you are able and willing to donate, you can be sure that it helps us significantly. All donations go directly into paying for our rent and other necessary costs so that we can remain open to the public.</p>
        <p>If you would like to make a single contribution to Liminal, you can do so by visiting our <a href="https://paypal.me/liminalflagstaff" target="_blank">PayPal</a>.</p>
        <h3>Monthly Donations</h3>
        <p>While one-time donations are incredibly helpful, small monthly contributions matter even more. Not only do recurring donations make paying rent more sustainable, but we believe that they symbolically represent a collective commitment to a community space which we are all meant to equally occupy. In other words, if you choose to donate to us on a monthly basis, you will effectively be participating in a process of paying 'communal rent'.</p>
        <p>Whether you are consistently making full use of Liminal as a free community center, or if you are only stopping by occasionally for tea, books, art supplies, clothes, or community events, choosing to give a monthly donation is extremely helpful and appreciated!</p>
        <p>If you would like to commit to making a monthly donation to Liminal, you can do so by visiting our <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=60963034" target="_blank">Patreon</a>.</p>

        <h2>Other Contributions</h2>
        <p>Non-monetary contributions are equally as important as monetary donations. All of the material resources that we freely provide during our open hours are donated by community members. Furthermore, most of our public amenities are serviced or maintained through volunteer labor.</p>
        <p>Here is a brief list of material donations and other contributions that we are always seeking:</p>
        <ul class="donations-list">
          <li><b>radical books</b></li>
          <li><b>clothing</b> - our unsheltered communities especially appreciate warm clothes, underwear, socks, sleeping bags, blankets, rain gear, and backpacks. All other sorts of clothes are also accepted.</li>
          <li><b>art supplies</b></li>
          <li><b>stationery items and working materials</b> - such as pens, pencils, paper, notebooks, binders, staplers, push pins, erasers, highlighters, dry erase markers, and so on.</li>
          <li><b>cleaning supplies</b></li>
          <li><b>skills</b> - such as carpentry, electrical assistance, plumbing assistance, and general maintenance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If there is something else you are interested in donating which is not listed above, please reach out to us!</p>

        <h2>Volunteering</h2>
        <h3>Volunteer Shifts for our Café</h3>
        <p>Liminal's cafe is completely operated by volunteers. That said, we are only able to be consistently open to the public as a free community space and resource center with the help of those who are willing to contribute their time watching over the space. If you would like to volunteer at our café, please fill out this short <a href="https://forms.gle/SHCd7AWbPXizy2127" target="_blank">questionnaire</a>. After submitted, we will send you an email providing access to the volunteer schedule, where you can sign up for shifts that work for your availability.</p>
