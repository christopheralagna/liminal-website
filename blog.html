      <div class=post-content>
        <p class="post-author">written by Christopher Alagna (co-director)</p>
        <p>I’m someone who wants to be as radical as possible in my thinking; I believe that truths of oppression are obscured by an unwillingness to look into them, or a difficulty in looking into them. The hegemony of a white-heteropatriarchal-capitalist culture not only teaches lies, but also forces us to shift our attention away from critical truths. It teaches us that racial oppression for the last 400 years is not real nor continual, that money intrinsically matters more than anything else, and that there is an objective / scientific way to look at the world that has nothing to do with history, culture, society, economics, or any other humanities topic. I refuse to have my thinking controlled by the state, as it is critical for the liberation of oppressed peoples that we do not let ourselves be lied to. I’ve come to learn, along with many others  who choose to resist or are forced to resist in order to survive, that this is a continual process of reimaging how to resist. Earnest and effective reistance will never come out of any singular realization.</p>
        <p>When I think about prevailing countercultural methods adopted in the pursuit of emancipation, what comes to mind for me is “progressivism” and “radicalism”. I’ve come to be somewhat critical of both methods, and for different reasons. At least in their purist forms, it seems to me that neither one approaches liberation in a way that is at the same time accessible and effective.</p>
        <p>I recently read an article in the socialist magazine, Jacobin, that discussed working-class people’s aversion to “progressive” culture. Noteably this aversion spans across the boundaries of race and gender. Even though most working-class people want state-sponsored changes regarding social-welfare infrastructure, they tend to dis-identify with progressive culture, and democratic identity. Undoubtedly, there is a valid reason for this dis-identification. Take for instance that, even though working class people clearly have more to gain from the purported goals that progressives seek (universal access to health care, affordable housing, etc), the most prominent demographic for self-identified progressives is the white, middle-class, working professional with a university education. Why then are working class people not leading the progressive movement? One explanation is that the democratic institution has been steeped in corporate-dominated corruption since at least the neoliberal turn in the 1980s. Just like Republicans, Democrats have relentlessly shown a commitment to privatizing all industry and welfare initiatives. It makes perfect sense then that working class people, who actually need government assistance to survive, are disillusioned with governmental initiatives. This is the reason that, consequently, we are seeing a substantial rise in neofascism. These are a few of the reasons why I very much reject self-identifying as politically “progressive”.</p>
        <p>Personally, I lean much more towards the methodology of “radicalism” because of its genuine desire to unite people, its critical truth-seeking processes, its refusal to be suppressed by state power, and its active efforts in on-the-grounds oppressive resistance. Even this approach to achieve liberation however, I believe to be fraught with contradictions. The militancy, the sloganisms, the dogmas, and the refusal to consider ideas that don’t come out of its own traditions, are a few of radicalism’s cultural tendencies which trouble me.</p>
        <p>During the creative process of inventing Liminal, I often felt split between two approaches: Do we lean more radical and risk alienating certain people due to the tradition’s militance and consequential inaccessibility? Or do we alternatively lean more less radical and risk the trust and support of people who make lifelong commitments to learning about oppression, who already are practiced with critical reflection, and who lead real resistance struggles? I didn’t want to compromise: I felt like we needed to consider both approaches, in order to learn from each one’s strengths and weaknesses.</p>
        <p>I have been very influenced by an activist who I felt walked this line well: Paulo Friere. His most popular work, Pedagogy of the Oppressed, proposes a reason and a method for making community education the center of liberatory struggle. It is about making the struggle for liberation both critical and accessible, both historically guided and open to new ideas, both prioritizing a no-nonsense strategy for real change and a process which refuses to compromise on the mutual engagement of all working-class people.</p>
        <p>Liminal’s educational praxis was inspired by this mergence of liberatory philosophies. It is yet another part of Liminal which strives to make tangible a space inbetween the margins of two competing or binary categories. We believe that education should be a practice of freedom, but we also believe that this process must necessarily involve dialectical engagement between all those who have a real desire to make a difference; an ongoing dialogue between the people, rather than a series of lectures given to the people by a few key individuals.</p>
        <p>‘Education as dialogue’ rejects the suppressive gate-keeping methods upheld by our public and private school systems. Liminal’s education program is about creating knowledge together: knowledge which we decide is meaningful to us. Through this process, we will become better able to abandon our reliance on state and corporate-sponsored educational institutions, which have no stake in our personal growth or collective success, and furthermore intend to keep us passive towards all contexts of oppression.</p>
        <p>The question that logically follows is: how can we actually make our proposed method of educational dialogue work? This is a fundamental question which I hope we can all work on solving together, and I believe the answer can only be achieved by this very process.</p>

      <h2>Why should there be a cafe in a community arts center?</h2>
      <div class=post-content>
        <p class="post-author">written by Christopher Alagna (co-director)</p>
        <p><i>First of all, when we call ourselves a ‘cafe’, we mean that we are a place that makes a variety of coffee drinks, as well as a place that offers meals. However, the inner workings of Liminal are more similar to that of a ‘coffeeshop’ than an American cafe. So for the purpose of explaining the relationship between a community arts center and a place that sells food and beverage, it makes more sense for us to use the word ‘coffeeshop’.</i></p>
        <p>It’s pretty uncommon for a community arts center to operate as a coffeeshop- but for Liminal, we believe these two kinds of spaces go hand in hand.</p>
        <p>Coffeeshops often facilitate community bonding. They are gathering centers that feel familiar: places where people are encouraged to freely pass through and where locals are welcome to comfortably spend their time with others. Many coffeeshops routinely hold events open to the public, and therefore also have established relationships with arts and culture, in addition to community.</p>
        <p>Of course, we plan to be more than just another local coffeeshop- from the coffeeshop model, we want to appropriate that which brings community together, and to change that which threatens to fracture community bonds. One major problem with coffeeshops is that, despite their artistic and integrationist reputations, they often perpetuate social divides.</p>
        <p>It is important to recognize that most coffeeshops are for-profit businesses, and as such, they prioritize profits over social inclusion. This means that poor and working class people are not only unwelcome- they are frequently either deterred by coercion or removed by force. This extends to instances of community-policing which are provoked by institutional racism, misogyny, homophobia, and other systems which oppress or inflict violence upon marginalized groups. In order to confront this pattern of injustice, we intend to be very explicit about our intolerance for discrimination, and furthermore, we will take action to make sure that those who are regularly pushed out of coffeeshops feel welcome.</p>
        <p>Another limitation that prevents coffeeshops from being great community centers, is actually a symptom of a larger cultural issue- which is that many people are not used to getting actively involved in their communities. Arts and culture events have great community potential: they have distinctive abilities to politically-educate us, to interpersonally connect us, and to creatively inspire us. But since most local events are put together without these goals in mind, their benefits are often relegated to simple entertainment or cultural tokenism. We have much greater ambitions for what we plan to offer our community through the arts- and we believe this starts with community cooperation.</p>
        <p>Unlike conventional coffeeshops, our allegiance is to our community (especially to those who are marginalized). In order to empower our community, we will continually curate art-related events and small-scale creative projects which are meant to engage us, and not simply to entertain us. We will be different than ordinary coffeeshops in so many ways, but maybe our core distinction (at least, as far as our restaurant operations go) is that we plan to prioritize people over profit.</p>

      <h2>Why am I Queer Before Anything Else?</h2>
      <h2 class="sub-header">Identity Politics Eclipsing the Intended Value of Art</h2>
      <div class=post-content>
        <p class="post-author">written by Ryan McElligott (co-director)</p>
        <p>Lately I've been sifting through the focality on identity politics within art-making and art-critiquing. Identity politics has proven to be a useful tool for discussing long-term issues revolving around solidarity and shared experience- however the process of reducing one’s personhood to a few key identities is undoubtedly a homogenizing, flattening and arguably  dehumanizing force. I see countless accounts of folks trying to validate that they've found ‘art of importance’ because it was made by a person of “x” identities- this reads to me as a method of commodifying marginalized people and the marginalized vectors of their personhood. When artists are discussing their art within the parameters/demarcations of identity, then sure, viewers are being asked to sort through articles of  identity. However, if all art being made by marginalized folks is foregrounded by identity politics, this becomes a dangerous failure in valuing the nuances of the art, especially when it negates the ways that which the artist intended for the subject to be received.</p>
        <p>I have found time and time again that my bodies of work, whether they be articles, oil paintings, zines, lithography, poetry, mixed media, etc. have always been discussed in relation to my queerness. While its absolutely true, I am gay and nonbinary, my work being continually located as a vector of my queerness is disappointing and frankly untrue. Beyond the idea that my drive to create is catalyzed out of such a small vector of my personhood, the focality on my queerness illuminates the extent to which we have been conditioned to expect marginalized people to ideologically / theoretically / artistically live strictly within the confines of their identities. Imagine if every heterosexual or cisgender artist’s work was continully being related to how they are heterosexual or cisgender: it would seem outrageously trivial and at best severely unrelated. This othering  process assumes that our marginalized identities are what take precedence within our thoughts // work // activism // modes of being // creation - while queer advocacy is on the table for fights I care deeply about, it is not what dominates my liberatory thinking nor artistic praxis.</p>
        <p>Mykki Blanco states that “ When work is created by a Queer artist and that work is not allowed to live and breathe on its own merits, without propping up some relationship to “Queerness” that is dangerous and violent to the creator. You have taken away our freedom and the vast, endless array of inspirations that may be the foundations of our ideas” (2020). Mykki Blanco is constantly discussed within the parameters of being a black queer artist- someone who paved the way for the mergence of performance art, being a rapper and a very hands-on activist. While they produce several bodies of work that mention their queerness/transness- it is apparent from their assertion in the previous statement, that the focality on this singular attribute of their identity, is frustrating and oppressive in itself.</p>
        <p>Marginalized artists already have to jump through hegemonic hoops of visibility; to then have to pivot our identities as selling points for our art perpetuates that our ideas must be foregrounded by commodying our own marginalization. And honestly it sucks- oppression is something to already consistently navigate. To hear that our work is strictly valuable when we monetize our oppression is sickening and arguably leads to corrupt ideas of self worth.</p>
        <p>It may be of value if we continue to keep artists' identities within our peripherals; in doing so we humanize and appreciate the dynamic nuances of the person who created the work, while remaining open to receive the work within the theoretical / emotional plane we are being invited to. In order to truly enact anti-capitalist ideation we must unlearn our habitual tendencies to commodify each other, ourselves and our ideas- even if they exist within the margins.</p>
