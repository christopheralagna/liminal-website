      <h2>Why should there be a cafe in a community arts center?</h2>
      <div class=post-content>
        <p class="post-author">written by Christopher Alagna (co-director)</p>
        <p><i>First of all, when we call ourselves a ‘cafe’, we mean that we are a place that makes a variety of coffee drinks, as well as a place that offers meals. However, the inner workings of Liminal are more similar to that of a ‘coffeeshop’ than an American cafe. So for the purpose of explaining the relationship between a community arts center and a place that sells food and beverage, it makes more sense for us to use the word ‘coffeeshop’.</i></p>
        <p>It’s pretty uncommon for a community arts center to operate as a coffeeshop- but for Liminal, we believe these two kinds of spaces go hand in hand.</p>
        <p>Coffeeshops often facilitate community bonding. They are gathering centers that feel familiar: places where people are encouraged to freely pass through and where locals are welcome to comfortably spend their time with others. Many coffeeshops routinely hold events open to the public, and therefore also have established relationships with arts and culture, in addition to community.</p>
        <p>Of course, we plan to be more than just another local coffeeshop- from the coffeeshop model, we want to appropriate that which brings community together, and to change that which threatens to fracture community bonds. One major problem with coffeeshops is that, despite their artistic and integrationist reputations, they often perpetuate social divides.</p>
        <p>It is important to recognize that most coffeeshops are for-profit businesses, and as such, they prioritize profits over social inclusion. This means that poor and working class people are not only unwelcome- they are frequently either deterred by coercion or removed by force. This extends to instances of community-policing which are provoked by institutional racism, misogyny, homophobia, and other systems which oppress or inflict violence upon marginalized groups. In order to confront this pattern of injustice, we intend to be very explicit about our intolerance for discrimination, and furthermore, we will take action to make sure that those who are regularly pushed out of coffeeshops feel welcome.</p>
        <p>Another limitation that prevents coffeeshops from being great community centers, is actually a symptom of a larger cultural issue- which is that many people are not used to getting actively involved in their communities. Arts and culture events have great community potential: they have distinctive abilities to politically-educate us, to interpersonally connect us, and to creatively inspire us. But since most local events are put together without these goals in mind, their benefits are often relegated to simple entertainment or cultural tokenism. We have much greater ambitions for what we plan to offer our community through the arts- and we believe this starts with community cooperation.</p>
        <p>Unlike conventional coffeeshops, our allegiance is to our community (especially to those who are marginalized). In order to empower our community, we will continually curate art-related events and small-scale creative projects which are meant to engage us, and not simply to entertain us. We will be different than ordinary coffeeshops in so many ways, but maybe our core distinction (at least, as far as our restaurant operations go) is that we plan to prioritize people over profit.</p>

      <h2>Why am I Queer Before Anything Else?</h2>
      <h2 class="sub-header">Identity Politics Eclipsing the Intended Value of Art</h2>
      <div class=post-content>
        <p class="post-author">written by Ryan McElligott (co-director)</p>
        <p>Lately I've been sifting through the focality on identity politics within art-making and art-critiquing. Identity politics has proven to be a useful tool for discussing long-term issues revolving around solidarity and shared experience- however the process of reducing one’s personhood to a few key identities is undoubtedly a homogenizing, flattening and arguably  dehumanizing force. I see countless accounts of folks trying to validate that they've found ‘art of importance’ because it was made by a person of “x” identities- this reads to me as a method of commodifying marginalized people and the marginalized vectors of their personhood. When artists are discussing their art within the parameters/demarcations of identity, then sure, viewers are being asked to sort through articles of  identity. However, if all art being made by marginalized folks is foregrounded by identity politics, this becomes a dangerous failure in valuing the nuances of the art, especially when it negates the ways that which the artist intended for the subject to be received.</p>
        <p>I have found time and time again that my bodies of work, whether they be articles, oil paintings, zines, lithography, poetry, mixed media, etc. have always been discussed in relation to my queerness. While its absolutely true, I am gay and nonbinary, my work being continually located as a vector of my queerness is disappointing and frankly untrue. Beyond the idea that my drive to create is catalyzed out of such a small vector of my personhood, the focality on my queerness illuminates the extent to which we have been conditioned to expect marginalized people to ideologically / theoretically / artistically live strictly within the confines of their identities. Imagine if every heterosexual or cisgender artist’s work was continully being related to how they are heterosexual or cisgender: it would seem outrageously trivial and at best severely unrelated. This othering  process assumes that our marginalized identities are what take precedence within our thoughts // work // activism // modes of being // creation - while queer advocacy is on the table for fights I care deeply about, it is not what dominates my liberatory thinking nor artistic praxis.</p>
        <p>Mykki Blanco states that “ When work is created by a Queer artist and that work is not allowed to live and breathe on its own merits, without propping up some relationship to “Queerness” that is dangerous and violent to the creator. You have taken away our freedom and the vast, endless array of inspirations that may be the foundations of our ideas” (2020). Mykki Blanco is constantly discussed within the parameters of being a black queer artist- someone who paved the way for the mergence of performance art, being a rapper and a very hands-on activist. While they produce several bodies of work that mention their queerness/transness- it is apparent from their assertion in the previous statement, that the focality on this singular attribute of their identity, is frustrating and oppressive in itself.</p>
        <p>Marginalized artists already have to jump through hegemonic hoops of visibility; to then have to pivot our identities as selling points for our art perpetuates that our ideas must be foregrounded by commodying our own marginalization. And honestly it sucks- oppression is something to already consistently navigate. To hear that our work is strictly valuable when we monetize our oppression is sickening and arguably leads to corrupt ideas of self worth.</p>
        <p>It may be of value if we continue to keep artists' identities within our peripherals; in doing so we humanize and appreciate the dynamic nuances of the person who created the work, while remaining open to receive the work within the theoretical / emotional plane we are being invited to. In order to truly enact anti-capitalist ideation we must unlearn our habitual tendencies to commodify each other, ourselves and our ideas- even if they exist within the margins.</p>
