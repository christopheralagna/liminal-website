      <div class="overview">
        <h3 class="h3-smaller">WHAT WE ARE</h3>
        <p>Liminal is a nonprofit café and community center that is completely volunteer-run. All purchases are PWYC (pay what you can) and you never have to buy anything in order to spend time here. Furthermore, café sales and donations go directly into keeping the space up and running.</p>
        <p>We have many free community resources and amenities which include clothing, art supplies, stationery items and working materials, harm reduction kits, radical books and zines, a public computer and free printing, an all-gender accessible public restroom, and a small classroom.</p>
        <p>We frequently host local art exhibitions, film and webinar screenings, safety trainings, queer-friendly parties, community meetings, classes and workshops, resource exchanges, free food gatherings, community fundraisers, performances, and other sorts of programs and events.</p>
        <p><i>We are open from 10am-6pm everyday.</i></p>
      </div>
      <div class="the-name">
        <h3 class="h3-smaller">OUR PURPOSE</h3>
        <p><i>The word ‘Liminal’ implies an in-between space: somewhere within the margins of what is easily defined or categorized.</i></p> 
        <p>Our intention is to explore diverse and intersecting forms of communal activity- to create ‘liminal’ spaces that are in opposition to oppressive binaries which underlie disconnected and hierarchical relationships.</p>
        <p>We believe that an intersectional anti-capitalist framework centered in arts, culture, education, celebration, food, and other means of connectivity, can motivate genuine community care, involvement, and fulfillment.</p>
      </div>
      <!--
      <div class="the-mission">
        <h3 class="h3-smaller">OUR PURPOSE</h3>
        <p>Our core motivation is to create collective spaces for exploring liberation and fulfillment through creative and grassroots modes of community education/involvement, while centering queer people and marginalized groups.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="theory-praxis">
        <h3 class="h3-smaller">THEORY + PRAXIS</h3>
        <p>Liminal can be understood to occupy both a physical space and a mental/emotional arena: a space to come in contact with intrinsic value in our lives, untangled from capitalist modes of value. In the act of coming together in order to reconsider new ways of living/being, we hope to make a significant impact on our collective cultural consciousness- so that we can each become empowered as active agents in matters of community + resistance (both on the local level and beyond).</p>

      <p>In order to make community meetings fun and emotionally/mentally sustainable, we follow each of them up with a small party which includes snacks, music, art making, and more!</p>

      <h2>Our Location</h2>
      <p>We find it critical to discuss the physical location of our space as it relates to the geopolitical conditions of our area- to do so allows us collectively to understand why this location is endangered and how to resist forces of gentrification.</p>
      <p>Liminal is located in so-called Flagstaff: formally colonized as a city in 1876. We are spatially located in the Southside Neighborhood, which rests between the two largest sources of Flagstaff's expanding corporate industry: downtown tourism (north) and Northern Arizona University (south). These capitalistic forces are primary perpetrators of ongoing local gentrification. The Southside Neighborhood - historically home to many low-income, unsheltered and BIPOC (black, indigenous, and people of color) folks - is being socially, economically and culturally encroached upon. As a result, many people are becoming victims of displacement, state-sanctioned violence and intimidation.</p>
      <p>Liminal intends to challenge the forces of Flagstaff gentrification through raising awareness of local issues, teaching anti-capitalist education, organizing community action and giving space to other radical organizations.</p>

      <h2>Tax Exempt Organization</h2>
      <p>Liminal is a non-profit corporation and shall be operated exclusively for charitable and educational purposes within the meaning of section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>
      
      <p>In accordance with these requirements, Liminal intends to meet the particular goals set forth below: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To support the inclusion of low-income, queer, and otherwise underprivileged members in our community, by providing a free everyday working space and cafe that hosts art exhibitions, educational workshops, and other special events to bring people together.</li>
        <li>To encourage a deeper local appreciation of and collective involvement with art and culture, especially for the marginalized and underprivileged members of our community, by providing free materials and offering free educational resources.</li>
        <li>To better unify our community by showcasing local art and by educating about issues of culture, through the active representation and involvement of individuals facing the effects of institutionalized oppression.</li>
        <li>To promote continuing-education and community collaboration by helping organize workshops led by people without professional certification, so that they can both share and better value their individual skillsets.</li>
