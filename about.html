      <div class="overview">
        <h3 class="h3-smaller">WHAT WE ARE</h3>
        <p>Liminal is an anti-capitalist arts and culture center and community collective. We are volunteer-run and consistently open to the public as a safe space for queer and marginalized folx to work, hang out, rest, get access to free material resources, hold meetings for community organizing initiatives, and temporarily escape the threat of police violence and individual harrasment which exists every day on the streets (especially within the SouthSide neighborhood where we are located).</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>We provide free access to clothes, art supplies, stationery items and working materials, radical books and zines, a computer and printing station, an all-gender accessible public restroom, and PWYC meals and drinks. We host space for local art exhibitions, radical film and webinar screenings, safety trainings, queer celebrations, group and panel discussions, political education, skill-sharing sessions, clothing exchanges, food gatherings and initiatives, mutual aid, performances, and other sorts of events and community programs.</p>

        <h3 class="h3-smaller">OUR PURPOSE</h3>
        <p><i>The word ‘Liminal’ implies an in-between space: somewhere within the margins of what is easily defined or categorized.</i></p> 
        <br><br>
        <p>Our core motivation is to create collective spaces for exploring liberation and fulfillment through diverse modes of community involvement, while centering queer people and marginalized folx.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>We believe that the mergence of grassroots activism/education and queer space/arts/culture/celebration is a praxis which can motivate genuine community care, solidarity, and action.</p>

      <div class="theory-praxis">
        <h3 class="h3-smaller">THEORY + PRAXIS</h3>
        <p>Liminal can be understood to occupy both a physical space and a mental/emotional arena: a space to come in contact with intrinsic value in our lives, untangled from capitalist modes of value. In the act of coming together in order to reconsider new ways of living/being, we hope to make a significant impact on our collective cultural consciousness- so that we can each become empowered as active agents in matters of community + resistance (both on the local level and beyond).</p>

      <h2>Our Location</h2>
      <p>We find it critical to discuss the physical location of our space as it relates to the geopolitical conditions of our area- to do so allows us collectively to understand why this location is endangered and how to resist forces of gentrification.</p>
      <p>Liminal is located in so-called Flagstaff: formally colonized as a city in 1876. We are spatially located in the Southside Neighborhood, which rests between the two largest sources of Flagstaff's expanding corporate industry: downtown tourism (north) and Northern Arizona University (south). These capitalistic forces are primary perpetrators of ongoing local gentrification. The Southside Neighborhood - historically home to many low-income, unsheltered and BIPOC (black, indigenous, and people of color) folks - is being socially, economically and culturally encroached upon. As a result, many people are becoming victims of displacement, state-sanctioned violence and intimidation.</p>
      <p>Liminal intends to challenge the forces of Flagstaff gentrification through raising awareness of local issues, teaching anti-capitalist education, organizing community action and giving space to other radical organizations.</p>
