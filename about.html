      <div class="the-name">
        <h3 class="h3-smaller">THE NAME</h3>
        <p>Liminal is unlike common iterations of public spaces - the name itself implies existing within the margins of what is easily defined or categorized.</p>
      </div>
<!--
      <div class="what-we-are">
        <h3 class="h3-smaller"></h3>WHAT WE ARE</h3>
        <p>Liminal can be understood as a community center rooted in the arts and social/communal justice, with the opportunity for community to address issues, solidarity, aid, networking, and integration.</p>
      </div>
-->
      <div class="what-we-offer">
        <h3 class="h3-smaller">WHAT WE OFFER</h3>
        <p>Liminal provides a free open work-space, free art supplies, anti-capitalist education, community skill-sharing, mutual aid networking, and many other programs/events!
          <br><br><i>When we say 'anti-capitalist', we understand this to imply the work of anti-racism, anti-imperialism, and decolonization.</i>
          <br><br>We also strive to host private meetings and public events of other local radical organizations for free. <a href="/contact/">Contact us</a> to request use of Liminal for your group.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="the-mission">
        <h3 class="h3-smaller">OUR PURPOSE</h3>
        <p>Our core motivation is to create collective spaces for exploring liberation and fulfillment through new modes of community/artistic involvement, and the centering of marginalized and queer people/topics.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="theory-praxis">
        <h3 class="h3-smaller">THEORY + PRAXIS</h3>
        <p>Liminal can be understood to occupy both a physical space and a mental/emotional arena: a space to come in contact with intrinsic value in our lives, untangled from capitalist modes of value. In the act of coming together in order to reconsider new ways of living/being, we hope to make a significant impact on our collective cultural consciousness- so that we can each become empowered as active agents in matters of community + resistance (both on the local level and beyond).</p>

    <div class="block" id="hours-of-operation">
      <h2>Hours of Operation</h2>
      <p><b>Tuesday + Thursday, 1pm - 5pm</b> (We hope to be open daily in the near future)</p>
      <p>During these hours, we are open to the public as a LGBTQIA+BIPOC safe-space for working // hanging-out // and making art!</p>
      <p>We provide snacks and drinks from our bar on a suggested-donation basis, although it is not necessary to purchase or consume anything. Outside food/drink are welcome! BYO anything (but no alcohol please)!</p>
      <p>We are also open during the times of scheduled classes and <a href="/events/">events</a></p>
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      <h2>Our Chosen Location</h2>
      <p>We find it critical to discuss the physical location of our space as it relates to the geopolitical conditions of our area- to do so allows us collectively to understand why this location is endangered and how to resist forces of gentrification.</p>
      <p>Liminal is located in so-called Flagstaff: formally colonized as a city in 1876. We are spatially located in the Southside Neighborhood, which rests between the two largest local industries: downtown tourism (north) and Northern Arizona University (south). These capitalistic forces are primary perpetrators of Flagstaff gentrification. The Southside Neighborhood - historically home to many low-income, unsheltered and BIPOC (black, indigenous, and people of color) folks - is being socially, economically and culturally encroached upon. As a result, many people are becoming victims of displacement, state-sanctioned violence and intimidation.</p>
      <p>Liminal intends to challenge the forces of Flagstaff gentrification through raising awareness of local issues, teaching political education, organizing community action and giving space to other radical organizations.</p>
