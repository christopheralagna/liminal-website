      <h1>Classes + Workshops</h1>
      <div class="books-img"></div>
      <p class="p-larger">Liminal will host classes and workshops led by members of our community. A schedule will be posted here to give details about past and upcoming learning opportunities.</p>
      <div class="community-education-description">
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Why Community Education?</h2>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p class="p-larger note" style="margin-top: 0rem">Each one of us possesses unique knowledge and skill sets, that which could greatly benefit those around us. This is the premise that motivated us to devise a community education program. It is important to note that our program is inspired by concepts of alternative education developed by others, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_education">popular education</a>, which was explored in great detail by educator and philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulo_Freire">Paulo Friere</a>.</p>
          <p class="p-larger">You might ask: ‘why aren’t state-recognized forms of education sufficient?’ It’s easy to think that universities and other expensive educational programs are the only places where people learn important information, and where ideas get developed that really matter. Ideas which are considered <i>important</i>, however, have been determined by the interests of corporations, the interests of the state, and the interests of those who otherwise hold the most social, cultural, and political power in the world. There are many other reasons to learn, and many other ideas to learn about. What if getting an education wasn’t about professionalizing or specializing, but was instead about furthering personal growth in whatever way that meant for you?</p>
          <p class="p-larger">Another reason to consider alternatives to standard forms of education is that there are many obstacles in place which make education both inaccessible and unequal. It’s a privilege to have access to higher education, and access to the resources necessary to succeed in completing any educational program. Higher education is also fiercely competitive, which sets up many disadvantaged students for failure. What if we could make education more equal, without relying on state or corporate funding?</p>
          <p class="p-larger">We believe that folks don’t need to have professional certification, or go into debt, in order to teach, to learn, and to grow. University education puts too much emphasis on individual success, and therefore neglects all that can come from mutual support and working together. Furthermore, community education can provide many benefits that universities lack, such as new perspectives on teaching, more accessible modes of learning, more intimate environments for bonding with others, newfound appreciation of those around us, the cultivation of self-confidence and personal empowerment, and so on.</p>
          <p class="p-larger">Moreover, this program provides real working opportunities, along with the ability to make money doing what we love to do. It also gives us the chance to share intimate parts of ourselves with others.</p>
          <p class="p-larger">We encourage anyone with EVEN THE SLIGHTEST interest in sharing their skill sets to contact us about teaching at Liminal. We do not require any prior teaching experience whatsoever. No matter your background, we are here to help you succeed by providing teaching materials, assisting you in structuring the layout of your workshops, and by helping get the word out about your future classes.</p>
