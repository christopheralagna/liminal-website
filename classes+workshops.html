      <h1>Classes + Workshops</h1>
      <div class="books-img"></div>
      <p class="p-larger">Liminal will host classes and workshops led by members of our community. A schedule will be posted here to give details about past and upcoming learning opportunities.</p>
      <div class="community-education-description">
        <h2>Why Community Education?</h2>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p class="p-larger note" style="margin-top: 0rem">Each one of us possesses unique knowledge and skill sets, that which could greatly benefit those around us. This is the premise that motivated us to devise a community education program. It is important to note that our program is inspired by concepts of alternative education developed by others, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_education">popular education</a>, which was explored in great detail by educator and philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulo_Freire">Paulo Friere</a>.</p>
          <p class="p-larger">You might ask: ‘why aren’t state-recognized forms of education sufficient?’ It’s easy to think that universities and other expensive educational programs are the only places where people learn important information, and where ideas get developed that really matter. Ideas which are considered <i>important</i>, however, have been determined by the interests of corporations, the interests of the state, and the interests of those who otherwise hold the most social, cultural, and political power in the world. There are many other reasons to learn, and many other ideas to learn about. What if getting an education wasn’t about professionalizing or specializing, but was instead about furthering personal growth in whatever way that meant for you?</p>
          <p class="p-larger">Another reason to consider alternatives to standard forms of education is that there are many obstacles in place which make education both inaccessible and unequal. It’s a privilege to have access to higher education, and access to the resources necessary to succeed in completing any educational program. Higher education is also fiercely competitive, which sets up many disadvantaged students for failure. What if we could make education more equal, without relying on state or corporate funding?</p>
          <p class="p-larger">We believe that folks don’t need to have professional certification, or go into debt, in order to teach, to learn, and to grow. University education puts too much emphasis on individual success, and therefore neglects all that can come from mutual support and working together. Furthermore, community education can provide many benefits that universities lack, such as new perspectives on teaching, more accessible modes of learning, more intimate environments for bonding with others, newfound appreciation of those around us, the cultivation of self-confidence and personal empowerment, and so on.</p>
          <p class="p-larger">Moreover, this program provides real working opportunities, along with the ability to make money doing what we love to do. It also gives us the chance to share intimate parts of ourselves with others.</p>
          <p class="p-larger">We encourage anyone with EVEN THE SLIGHTEST interest in sharing their skill sets to contact us about teaching at Liminal. We do not require any prior teaching experience whatsoever. No matter your background, we are here to help you succeed by providing teaching materials, assisting you in structuring the layout of your workshops, and by helping get the word out about your future classes.</p>

        <h2>To Those Interested in Teaching</h2>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p class="p-larger">We are so excited to hear from all of you who are interested in teaching with Liminal! We’ve decided the best way to give you more information about becoming a teacher in our community education program is to provide an initial Q&A list. If you have any other questions about teaching, please reach out to us through our <a href="/contact/">contact form</a> or through our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/liminal.flagstaff/">instagram</a>. We are more than happy to talk with you!</p>
          <div class="q-and-a">
            <h3 class="question">How can I propose my class idea to Liminal?<div class="triangle"></div></h3>
            <p class="p-larger answer">We encourage you to get in contact with us through whatever means in order to communicate your class idea. There is no formal proposal process or application.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="q-and-a">
            <h3 class="question">What are the requirements for holding a class at Liminal?<div class="triangle"></div></h3>
            <p class="p-larger answer">We don’t believe in gatekeeping or formal requirements which would give access to certain people and deprive access to others. Therefore, there are no certification requirements, no topic requirements, no structural requirements, and so on. We want all of you to succeed, so we’ll do what we can to make your class happen. <i>The one thing we require is that your course be anti-discriminatory, and we will soon have a policy in place to explain exactly what that means.</i></p>
          </div>
          <div class="q-and-a">
            <h3 class="question">What assistance can Liminal offer me for teaching?<div class="triangle"></div></h3>
            <p class="p-larger answer">We are happy to provide you with anything we can in order to make your proposed class a success! We can offer you advising, advertising, moral support, help creating your curriculum, teaching materials, art materials (if applicable), and help moving stuff around in our space to best accommodate your class.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="q-and-a">
            <h3 class="question">What control do I have over my classes at Liminal?<div class="triangle"></div></h3>
            <p class="p-larger answer">You are given full autonomy in deciding all aspects of your classes or workshops. Just to name a few implications, this means that you can set your own hours, your own prices,  your own curriculum, and your own expectations of student behavior (although, we will also set in place a very strict policy against anti-discriminatory behavior from all students).</p>
          </div>
          <div class="q-and-a">
            <h3 class="question">Where can I teach?<div class="triangle"></div></h3>
            <p class="p-larger answer">You are always welcome to teach on the premises of Liminal, although you may teach at a different location if you please (you will still receive advertising on our website, and whatever other means of assistance we can provide you). We also encourage virtual workshops, and we can help you with setting up a virtual platform.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="q-and-a">
            <h3 class="question">When can I teach?<div class="triangle"></div></h3>
            <p class="p-larger answer">If you do choose to hold your classes at Liminal, we will do our best to accommodate your preferred hours of teaching. We will have dedicated class hours at our location each day, where we will temporarily shut down our café in order to make space for classes. For smaller workshops, you are welcome to teach during café hours. If you do not choose to hold your classes at Liminal, you can teach whenever you want!</p>
          </div>
          <div class="q-and-a">
            <h3 class="question">How can I make money teaching at Liminal?<div class="triangle"></div></h3>
            <div class="answer">
              <p class="p-larger">We have done our best to come up with a way to make it possible to set up our own little anti-capitalist education-based economy at Liminal within legal boundaries. So here are the fundamental details on how we’ve decided this initially will work:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>We suggest that you ask for <i>recommended donations</i> from students who attend your classes or workshops. This way, you will not be legally responsible for paying taxes on any of the income that you make. Of course, you may charge fixed prices for students if you wish.</li>
                <li>We will charge you the value of 25% of the money you receive. All of the money Liminal takes will be put back into Liminal programs so that we can better sustain the costs of our continued operations.</li>
              </ol>
              <p class="p-larger">Eventually we will have more detailed guidelines on this in place. For the time being, if you have any questions about this process or suggestions for this process, please do not hesitate to reach out.</p>
