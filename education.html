      <h2>Our Educational Perspectives</h2>
      
      <p class="">There are a few theoretical concepts which inform the way we approach education. Select the topics below to learn more:</p>

      <div class="q-and-a">
        <h4 class="question">Events as Education<div class="triangle"></div></h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p><a href="/events/">Events</a> are at the core of Liminal’s praxis.</p>
          <p>All events hosted by Liminal can be understood as diversified forms of anti-capitalist education, where the ongoing mergence of <b>activity</b> and <b>theory</b> will take place. Below are some examples:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>potlucks // food accessibility</li>
            <li>clothing swaps // LGBTQIA and subversive fashion</li>
            <li>film critiques // cultural hegemony</li>
            <li>jazz listening // black history + erasure</li>
            <li>art making // resistance</li>
            <li>community celebration // community issues</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We believe that events which prioritize active community discussion / involvement bring about a learning environment which is immediately applicable, accessible, mutually supportive, enticing, resists gate-keeping, resists competitive individualism and feels collectively empowering.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="q-and-a">
        <h4 class="question">Community Education<div class="triangle"></div></h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>In an attempt to cultivate modes of learning which are communally-based // and mutually-driven, many programs at Liminal will consist of classes and workshops led by members of our community.</p>
          <p>This initiative is in direct opposition to the hierarchical methods of corporate and state-sponsored education - which is notoriously inaccessible, unaffordable, hyper-competitive, and guided by state and corporate interests.</p>
          <p>We believe that folks don’t need to have professional certification, or go into debt, in order to learn, to teach, and to grow. By putting an emphasis on mutual community support, community education can provide new perspectives on teaching, more accessible modes of learning, more relevant // vital topics of discussion, more intimate environments for bonding with others, newfound appreciation of those around us, the cultivation of self-confidence and personal empowerment, and so on.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="q-and-a">
        <h4 class="question">Political Education<div class="triangle"></div></h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>One of Liminal’s many anti-capitalist objectives is to help spread teachings about oppression and resistance strategies. Therefore, much of our programming will be based around the tradition of ‘political education’ (explained below). This initiative will take form as a series of ongoing courses, book clubs, panel discussions, and various other educational programs and events.</p>
          <p><b>Issues with Mainstream Education</b><br>You might ask: ‘Aren’t state-recognized forms of education sufficient?’ It’s easy to think that universities and other expensive educational programs are the only places where people learn valuable information, and where ideas get developed that really matter. However, ideas which are commonly considered ‘important’ have been determined by the interests of corporations, the interests of the state, and the interests of those who otherwise hold the most social, cultural, and political power.</p>
          <p>Privatized and state-sponsored education are capitalistic initiatives: corporations profit and nations benefit, both from the skilled labor of graduated students, and also from the cultural indoctrination that results from prescribed educational topics/materials which bolster national ideals. These institutions are fundamentally opposed to liberatory and anti-capitalistic education. Therefore, revolutionaries have historically organized anti-institutional and grassroots ways of arming the working class with knowledge that can demystify the complicated nature of oppression; one such iteration is known as ‘political education’.</p>
          <p><b>Political Education as a Solution</b><br>Political education (originally ‘popular education’) is all of the following: a tradition, a method of teaching (pedagogy), and a commitment to spreading knowledge of oppression rooted in capitalism. The tradition of political education stems from the work of <a href="https://www.freire.org/paulo-freire/">Paulo Friere</a>, who was an educator and philosopher in Brazil during the mid 20th century. He asserted that education ought to be ‘a practice of freedom’, and that liberatory ideas must be taught through the mutual guidance of the people, rather than from middle-upper class individuals with professional status or extensive academic recognition. In following the legacy of Friere's teachings, many other organizations - such as <a href="https://politicaleducation.peoplesforum.org/courses">The People's Forum</a> - have created free or affordable political education programs.</p>
          <p>In a university setting, you are not likely to learn about oppression, let alone how to resist oppression. An anti-capitalist curriculum would include subjects like: community and conflict, political economics, work and welfare, cultural hegemony and ideological control, political power and state repression, histories of colonialism, and/or global development. Such a curriculum might also include the intellectual tradition of black internationalism/radicalism: an especially important topic which would put contemporary issues of racism into a meaningful historical context; thus illuminating centuries of capitalistic racial exploitation (<a href="https://globalsocialtheory.org/topics/racial-capitalism/">racial capitalism</a>). The integration of these fields of study are vital to truly understanding how the world works in terms of power.</p>
          <p>Liminal will need plenty of help from our community in our pursuit of developing anti-capitalist curriculums. Please reach out if you would like to work with us to plan and organize classes // events // and other initiatives of this sort!</p>

      <div class="community-education-description">
        <h2>Why Community Education?</h2>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p class="p-larger note" style="margin-top: 0rem">Each one of us possesses unique knowledge and skill sets, that which could greatly benefit those around us. This is the premise that motivated us to devise a community education program. It is important to note that our program is inspired by concepts of alternative education developed by others, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_education">popular education</a>, which was explored in great detail by educator and philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulo_Freire">Paulo Friere</a>.</p>
          <p class="p-larger">You might ask: ‘why aren’t state-recognized forms of education sufficient?’ It’s easy to think that universities and other expensive educational programs are the only places where people learn important information, and where ideas get developed that really matter. Ideas which are considered <i>important</i>, however, have been determined by the interests of corporations, the interests of the state, and the interests of those who otherwise hold the most social, cultural, and political power in the world. There are many other reasons to learn, and many other ideas to learn about. What if getting an education wasn’t about professionalizing or specializing, but was instead about furthering personal growth in whatever way that meant for you?</p>
          <p class="p-larger">Another reason to consider alternatives to standard forms of education is that there are many obstacles in place which make education both inaccessible and unequal. It’s a privilege to have access to higher education, and access to the resources necessary to succeed in completing any educational program. Higher education is also fiercely competitive, which sets up many disadvantaged students for failure. What if we could make education more equal, without relying on state or corporate funding?</p>
          <p class="p-larger">We believe that folks don’t need to have professional certification, or go into debt, in order to teach, to learn, and to grow. University education puts too much emphasis on individual success, and therefore neglects all that can come from mutual support and working together. Furthermore, community education can provide many benefits that universities lack, such as new perspectives on teaching, more accessible modes of learning, more intimate environments for bonding with others, newfound appreciation of those around us, the cultivation of self-confidence and personal empowerment, and so on.</p>
          <p class="p-larger">Moreover, this program provides real working opportunities, along with the ability to make money doing what we love to do. It also gives us the chance to share intimate parts of ourselves with others.</p>
          <p class="p-larger">You can learn more in depth about the reasoning behind our proposed education program from one of our blog posts entitled "<a href="/blog/#education-post">Liminal's Community Education Program</a>".</p>
          <p class="p-larger">We encourage anyone with EVEN THE SLIGHTEST interest in sharing their skill sets to contact us about teaching at Liminal. We do not require any prior teaching experience whatsoever. No matter your background, we are here to help you succeed by providing teaching materials, assisting you in structuring the layout of your workshops, and by helping get the word out about your future classes.</p>
