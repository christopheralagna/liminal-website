SPW provides capacity-building assistance and trainings to individuals and service organizations, including behavioral health and law enforcement. We recognize drug use as a public health concern that impacts everybody, and we utilize a framework of equity and evidence-based practices to intervene on preventable risks."</p>
          <p>We will be making hygeine kits, wound-care kits, safer drug-use kits, and more!</p>
          <p>Liminal is a free distribution center for harm reduction supplies, so many of the kits will remain on site to be given out here.</p>

          <p>Capoeira performances at Liminal are put on by local nonprofit organization Centro de Capoeira Angola OuroVerde Flagstaff.</p>
          <p>Put in their own words: "Capoeira Angola is one of the best disciplines for developing a mobile, strong, and supple body, learning about African Brazilian culture, and becoming part of a global community."</p>
          <p>In between songs they consistently provide ideas that help us learn that, although the art form is often sensationalized as a spectacle to behold, Capoeira has deep cultural roots that are important to understand. It seems that as outsiders, we are actually being given a privilege to witness something that is not being made for us, and yet we are warmly invited to participate with our company.</p>
          <p>Entry is free, and everyone is welcome!</p>

          <h2>Queer Yoga & Stretching</h2>
          <p class="event-date">Monday July 5, 2021</p>
          <p>7pm - 9pm</p>
          <p>A queer body-positive yoga session. The class will address physical accessibility, body-positivity, and will promote an active awareness of the capitalistic implications of cultural appropriation.</p>
          <p>Upon considering the relationship between queerness and physical exercise, broad questions are able to be posed about emancipatory possibilities: What does it look like to be removed from cis-white-patriarchal-capitalistic notions of ‘health’? What important health issues for LGBTQIA+ people and BIPOC communities exist beyond the scope of physical exercise?</p>

          <h2>Xenofeminism: Intro Class</h2>
          <p class="event-date">Thursday July 8, 2021</p>
          <p>7pm - 9pm</p>
          <p>In an era of accelerating technology and increasing complexity, how should we reimagine the emancipatory potential of feminism? This is one of the core questions proposed by the contemporary political framework referred to as 'xenofeminism'.</p>
          <p>This event is an initial meetup for those interested in learning about the topic: how should we go about engaging it together?</p>
          <p>No matter the method we choose, the goal of this class will be to break down the theory, apply it to a diverse set of practical life circumstances, and see if we can make use of xenofeminism for future community projects.</p>

          <p>This evening will be both a group learning session and an open discussion. Come share your knowledge/perspectives about the injustices which shape the colonial tendencies of our local town. Feel free to bring readings/media which can help us deconstruct these issues.</p>

          <h2>Community Project (Radical Mapping)</h2>
          <p class="event-date">Friday June 25, 2021</p>
          <p>6pm - 9pm</p>
          <p>Let’s make community-based maps together!</p>
          <p>Although we may not often think about it, maps and profit are tightly interlinked. Corporations like Apple, Google, Yelp, Uber, Zillow, and countless others, use GPS systems in order to sell their mapping product, as well as to provide a platform which raises the profits of other already-successful businesses</p>
          <p>Instead of being used as tools for locating restaurants or navigating city centers, how else might maps be able to be used? In an effort to make mapping useful for communities rather than businesses, this event will have us share our knowledge about places that hold community resources/organizations, safe/dangerous spaces, queer experiences, marginalized histories, and any other anti-capitalistic information that we can put on a map!</p>
          <p>We will collectively consider how to safely disperse these maps to our community as vital survival // educational // and emotional resources.</p>
          <p>Here are some existing radical mapping projects to give you an idea of the sort of work we’ll be attempting:</p>

          <h2>Abolitionist Legal Self Defense Webinar</h2>
          <p class="event-date">Thursday, August 26, 2021</p>
          <p>5:30pm</p>
          <p>We are hosting a gathering at Liminal to collectively watch an Abolitionist Legal Self Defense webinar put on by <a href="https://seedingsovereignty.org/">Seeding Sovereignty</a> and the <a href="https://celdf.org/">Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund</a>!</p>
          <p>“Law enforcement officers enact violence on people and communities by criminalizing certain identities in categories such as race, class, Indigeneity, immigration status, gender and gender conformity, and physical and mental ability, to name but a few, as well as by targeting people who resist and critique this unjust system.</p>
          <p>While our "rights" according to the US Constitution were not written for and are not meaningfully applied to most of us in this movement, knowing these rights as part of an ongoing practice of legal self defense can help us stay as safe as possible in a system where we are targeted for our existence and our resistance.</p>
          <p>Join us for a conversation to share legal self defense best practices and to critique the role of police in stabilizing an oppressive status quo.”</p>
          <p>We’ll be visually projecting the webinar so that everyone can watch together. Bring any questions you may have so we can present them to the hosts during the Q&A section. Masks are mandatory!</p>
