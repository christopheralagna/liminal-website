          <p class="event-date">Wednesday June 2, 2021</p>
          <p>A night of film watching/critiquing! Deconstructing visual media and popular story narratives together can provide us collective insight into the issues of dominant culture that industries like Hollywood (and even independent producers) perpetuate.</p>
          <p>Alongside this film, we will also be showing a movie that is friendly for kids, so you can bring your kiddos along too!</p>

          <h2>Queer Health Gathering (weekly)</h2>
          <p class="event-date">Saturday June 5, 2021</p>
          <p>What would it look like to be removed from cis-white-patriarchal-capitalistic notions of ‘health’? How can we make health for LGBTQIA+ people and BIPOC communities a collective and sustainable priority?</p>
          <p>This events will consist of: stretching and light physical activity in the backyard, untangling harmful narratives surrounding health and the health industry, sharing foods that make us feel best, and planning ongoing/routined exercise groups and health practices for queers!</p>

          <p class="event-date">Sunday June 6, 2021</p>
          <p>What is it that matters to you in our community? Let’s dream up different events, classes, book clubs, activist initiatives, and mutual-aid collaborations that reflect our collective interests // desires // political agendas. Let’s collectively discuss ongoing community issues and check-in on our strategies, progress, and energy levels.</p>
          <p>In order to make community meetings fun and emotionally/mentally sustainable, we will follow each of them up with a small party! (free food/drink, music, art making, and more!)</p>

          <h2>Tarot Jazz Night!</h2>
          <p class="event-date">Wednesday June 9, 2021</p>
          <p>A themed party- It might seem like an odd pairing, but you’ll be surprised how well they can compliment one-another.</p>
          <p>Come look into the future, as well as the past: people will be giving tarot readings, and a curated selection of culturally-vital jazz standards will be playing in the background. In accordance with the future/past theme, there will also be dispersed written materials about the topics of (afro)futurism and black (jazz) history.</p>
          <p>Food and drinks will be available for purchase!</p>

          <h2>Art Meet-up (Fractured Communities)</h2>
          <p class="event-date">Wednesday June 16, 2021</p>
          <p>A time to merge art // community // and resistance! Let’s paint/draw, make zines, plan future exhibitions, and have creative discussions around the theme of ‘fractured communities’.</p>
          <p>You do not need to have any prior experience with art making or art curation in order to participate. Instead of positioning art as a technical skillset, we will celebrate art as a creative expression of radical ideas which can have a positive impact on our community.</p>

          <h2>(So-called) Flagstaff History Night</h2>
          <p class="event-date">Wednesday June 23, 2021</p>
          <p>How can learning more about the current/historical context of Flagstaff, including its evolving relationship to institutionalized exploitation and violence, bring us closer together in solidarity and resistance?</p>
          <p>This evening will be both a group learning session and an open discussion. Come share your knowledge/perspectives about the injustices which shape the colonial tendencies of our local town. Feel free to bring readings/media which can help us deconstruct these issues.</p>
          <p>You don’t need any prior knowledge in order to participate! Just bring a willingness to learn and an open mind.</p>

          <h2>Community Project (Radical Mapping)</h2>
          <p class="event-date">Friday June 25, 2021</p>
          <p>Let’s make community-based maps together!</p>
          <p>Although we may not often think about it, maps and profit are tightly interlinked. Corporations like Apple, Google, Yelp, Uber, Zillow, and countless others, use GPS systems in order to sell their mapping product, as well as to provide a platform which raises the profits of other already-successful businesses</p>
          <p>Instead of being used as tools for locating restaurants or navigating city centers, how else might maps be able to be used? In an effort to make mapping useful for communities rather than businesses, this event will have us share our knowledge about places that hold community resources/organizations, safe/dangerous spaces, queer experiences, marginalized histories, and any other anti-capitalistic information that we can put on a map!</p>
          <p>We will collectively consider how to safely disperse these maps to our community as vital survival // educational // and emotional resources.</p>
          <p>Here are some existing radical mapping projects to give you an idea of the sort of work we’ll be attempting:</p>
